##Game: Who is the Spy


The project is built using Next.js<br>
<br>
In the game, we need to enter  least 3 and a maximum of 12 players.
<br>
<br>
Only one player will receive the "spy" role, Nobody will know who is spy.
<br>
<br>
It is up to the other players to figure out who the spy is by asking questions, based on this lack of knowledge
<br>
<br>
 The game proceeds to the next stage when all players see their cards.
<br>
<br>
During this time, players take turns asking each other questions, and they must figure out who the spy is based on the answers.
